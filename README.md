Accurate Cyber Defense Social Engineering Toolkit GUI is an educational cybersecurity application designed to provide hands-on understanding of social engineering threats and their countermeasures.
Accurate Cyber Defense Phishing Botnet is a sophisticated malicious framework designed to automate large-scale credential harvesting campaigns. 
It deploys convincing phishing pages that mimic legitimate services to deceive users into entering their sensitive login information. 

The toolkit integrates with Telegram, allowing administrators to receive instant notifications and reports when a simulated phishing or whaling attempt is triggered. 
This feature ensures trainers can monitor results in real time, analyze responses, and deliver feedback directly within secure communication channels.
